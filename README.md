EditPDF
=======

An application for editing PDF files. The idea is to design a GUI specifically
to support the PDF format, thereby minimizing the inaccuracies present in other
approaches that depend on conversions between formats.

This project is written in Python 2 and uses the Qt library for the GUI and the
Freetype library to display embedded fonts. This is a work in progress, and
doesn't even have basic functionality yet. Maybe one day, when I get more free
time.
